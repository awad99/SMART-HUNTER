[01:00:09] [INFO] testing if the target URL content is stable
[01:00:10] [WARNING] target URL content is not stable (i.e. content differs). sqlmap will base the page comparison on a sequence matcher. If no dynamic nor injectable parameters are detected, or in case of junk results, refer to user's manual paragraph 'Page comparison'

[01:00:10] [ERROR] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. You can give it a go with the switch '--text-only' if the target page has a low percentage of textual content (~72.32% of page content is text). If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment'), skipping to the next target
