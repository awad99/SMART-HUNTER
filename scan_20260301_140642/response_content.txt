      <p>Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $30,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>If you have found a vulnerability, <a href="https://hackerone.com/github">submit it here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find useful information in our <a href="#rules">rules</a>, <a href="#scope">scope</a>, <a href="#targets">targets</a> and <a href="#faqs">FAQ</a> sections.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

    <h2 class="with-anchor">Rewards</h2>

    <dl class="rewards">
      <p>All bounty submissions are rated by GitHub using a purposefully simple scale. Each vulnerability is unique, but the following is a rough guideline we use internally for rating and rewarding submissions:</p>

      
        <hr/>
        <span class="available-bounty-summary"><strong>$20,000</strong> - <strong>$30,000+</strong></span>
        <dt>Critical</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Critical severity issues present a direct and immediate risk to a broad array of our users or to a GitHub product itself. They often affect relatively low-level/foundational components in one of our application stacks or infrastructure. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arbitrary code/command execution on a server in our production network</li>
  <li>arbitrary SQL queries on a production database</li>
  <li>bypassing the login process, either password or 2FA</li>
  <li>access to sensitive production user data or access to internal production systems</li>
  <li>accessing another user’s data in the GitHub Actions service</li>
</ul>

<p>The upper bound for critical vulnerabilities, $30,000, is only a guideline, and GitHub may reward higher amounts for exceptional reports.</p>

        </dd>
      
        <hr/>
        <span class="available-bounty-summary"><strong>$10,000</strong> - <strong>$20,000</strong></span>
        <dt>High</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>High severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify highly sensitive data that they are not authorized to access. They are generally more narrow in scope than critical issues, though they may still grant an attacker extensive access. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>injecting attacker controlled content into GitHub.com (XSS) that bypasses CSP</li>
  <li>bypassing authorization logic to grant a repository or package collaborator more access than intended</li>
  <li>discovering sensitive user or GitHub data in a publicly exposed resource, such as an S3 bucket</li>
  <li>overwriting a customer repository or package that should be inaccessible</li>
  <li>gaining access to a non-critical resource that only employees should be able to reach</li>
  <li>using the GitHub Actions repo-scoped GitHub token to access high-risk private content outside of that repository</li>
  <li>sending authentication credentials from a client app to an unintended server</li>
  <li>code execution in a client app that requires no user interaction, such as arbitrary code execution upon repo clone or via a protocol handler</li>
</ul>

        </dd>
      
        <hr/>
        <span class="available-bounty-summary"><strong>$4,000</strong> - <strong>$10,000</strong></span>
        <dt>Medium</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Medium severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify limited amounts of data that they are not authorized to access. They generally grant access to less sensitive information than high severity issues. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disclosing the title of issues in private repositories, which should be be inaccessible</li>
  <li>injecting attacker controlled content into GitHub.com (XSS) but not bypassing CSP or executing sensitive actions with another user’s session</li>
  <li>bypassing CSRF validation for low risk actions, such as starring a repository or unsubscribing from a mailing list</li>
  <li>code execution in a client app that requires minimal, expected user interaction, such as performing actions on a repository or <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/config#ignore-scripts">with a package</a> that a user would not expect to lead to code execution</li>
  <li>package integrity compromise, i.e., downloading a package that does not match the integrity as defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package-lock.json</code></li>
</ul>

        </dd>
      
        <hr/>
        <span class="available-bounty-summary"><strong>$617</strong> - <strong>$2,000</strong></span>
        <dt>Low</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Low severity issues allow an attacker to access extremely limited amounts of data. They may violate an expectation for how something is intended to work but allow nearly no escalation of privilege or ability to trigger unintended behavior by an attacker. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>signing up arbitrary users for access to an “early access feature” without their consent</li>
  <li>creating an issue comment that bypasses our image proxying filter by providing a malformed URL</li>
  <li>triggering verbose or debug error pages without proof of exploitability or obtaining sensitive information</li>
  <li>triggering application exceptions that could affect many users</li>
  <li>injecting JavaScript event handlers into links, etc., that are mitigated by CSP on GitHub.com</li>
  <li>disclosing the existence of private packages on npm that should be inaccessible, e.g., through error messages (but not through timing attacks, which are ineligible)</li>
  <li>novel supply chain vulnerabilities that affect a GitHub product but are not solely limited to that product</li>
  <li>credentials such as those from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.npmrc</code> file or from GitHub Enterprise Server being leaked in logs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy as “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this bug bounty program’s scope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want you to coordinate disclosure through our bug bounty program, and don’t want researchers put in fear of legal consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action you think might go outside the bounds of our policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties. We may provide non-identifying substantive information from your report to an affected third party, but only after notifying you and receiving a commitment that the third party will not pursue legal action against you. We will only share identifying information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) with a third party if you give your written permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If your security research as part of the bug bounty program violates certain restrictions in our site policies, the safe harbor terms permit a limited exemption.</li>
  <li>If you cannot accept a bounty reward for any reason, please ensure that you inform us when you submit your report, as there is no way to rescind the payment once awarded.</li>

    <p>If you would prefer to donate your bounty reward to an established 501(c)(3) charitable organization, GitHub will match your donation. If the bounty has already been processed into your account, it can no longer be donated through HackerOne and is no longer eligible for matching donations. To reduce the likelihood of a bounty being processed before it can be donated, we recommend <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/payout-methods.html">changing your payment preferences to monthly in your account settings</a>. To donate your reward and have it matched, submit a support ticket to HackerOne with the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the report ID for which you want to donate the bounty;</li>
      <li>the name and website of the charity you want to donate to;</li>
      <li>that you would like the donation matched using GitHub’s process; and</li>
      <li>whether you want to be named as the donor or would prefer to remain anonymous. Keep in mind that we can only attribute the donation to you if the charity allows us to give a name.</li>

    <h2 class="with-anchor">FAQs</h2>

    <dl class="q-and-a">
      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-0">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>How is the bounty reward determined?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Our security and development teams take many factors into account when determining a reward. These factors include the complexity of successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the potential exposure, as well as the percentage of impacted users and systems. Sometimes an otherwise critical vulnerability has a very low impact simply because it is mitigated by some other component, e.g., it requires user interaction, it relies on an obscure web browser, or it would need to be combined with another vulnerability that does not currently exist. Our teams use <a href="/#rewards">our documented severity guidelines</a> to determine the bounty reward amounts rather than correlating with CVSS ratings. Additionally, at least two GitHub security engineers agree on the severity and amount before a payout is made.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-1">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>Can I submit a video proof-of-concept?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You can certainly attach a video if you believe it will clarify your submission. However, all submissions must also include step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug. The security team will let you know if we think a video will clarify your report. Submissions which only include video reproduction steps will have a longer response time and we may close your submission as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Not Applicable</code>.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-2">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>Did my submission just get rejected by a bot?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You may get a response that appears to be from a bot. The bot does some work for us, but only when we tell it to. We “do our own stunts” at GitHub Security. An application security engineer at GitHub triages each submission. In most cases, we use the bot to automate messaging and other tasks for us. Rest assured, a human did look at your submission.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-3">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>Can I submit my report via a third-party or vulnerability broker?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>GitHub’s Bug Bounty program is designed to both reward individual researchers and increase the security of all GitHub users. We don’t believe that disclosing GitHub vulnerabilities to third parties achieves either of those goals. As a result, any vulnerabilities that are disclosed to third-party before being submitted to our program are ineligible for rewards.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-4">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>Why does severity on HackerOne not match the reward I was given?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We do not always update HackerOne with the assessed severity because we track that information internally. Our payout guidelines and the value of the reward dictate our assessment of severity, not the severity on HackerOne.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-5">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>Where is your PGP key? I want to use it when I submit a vulnerability.</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you absolutely believe encrypting the message is necessary, please read our <a href="/pgp.html">instructions and caveats for PGP submissions</a>.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-6">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>What kinds of DoS submissions are valid?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>As noted in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">performing your research</code> section, denial of service research is best done on your own instance of GHES. Causing an availability issue is simply not helpful.  We are only interested in denial of service issues at the application layer (logic bombs, ReDoS, etc.). Volumetric attack submissions are not eligible for rewards and we may suspend your GitHub account or temporarily ban your IP address.</p>

        
      </dd>

      
      <a class="faq-link" id="faq-7">&nbsp;</a>
      <dt>How can I earn an invitation to the GitHub VIP program?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We’re stoked to hear you’d like to become a Hacktocat! In order to be eligible to receive an invitation, you must earn at least $20,000 in our program and have submitted at least 2 reports over the last 2 years. Please note that meeting this criteria does not guarantee an invitation. We reserve the right to extend invitations at our discretion. We review eligibility and make decisions on candidates on a quarterly basis.</p>

      <dt>What are the benefits of joining the VIP program?</dt>
      <dd>
